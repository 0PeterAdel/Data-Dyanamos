Step 1: Loading the Data
We assume the Excel file contains at least two sheets with the following structure:

'Employee' Sheet: Columns include EmployeeID, Age, DistanceFromHome, Department, JobRole, Salary, HireDate, Attrition, YearsAtCompany, YearsSinceLastPromotion.
'PerformanceRating' Sheet: Columns include EmployeeID, ReviewDate, EnvironmentSatisfaction, JobSatisfaction, WorkLifeBalance, ManagerRating.

Analysis 1: Employee Engagement Analysis
Objective
This analysis measures employee satisfaction and motivation using the EnvironmentSatisfaction column from performance data and correlates it with performance metrics (ManagerRating). It helps identify areas for improvement, such as the work environment or corporate culture, if satisfaction levels are low.

Steps
Extract the latest performance review for each employee.
Merge it with employee data.
Analyze and visualize environmental satisfaction.
Explore its relationship with performance.

Interpretation
Average Environmental Satisfaction: A score near 5 indicates high satisfaction, while a score below 3 suggests dissatisfaction and a need for improvement in the work environment or culture.
Distribution: If the histogram skews left (higher values), most employees are satisfied. A right skew (lower values) indicates widespread dissatisfaction.
Correlation: A positive value (e.g., 0.3 or higher) suggests that satisfied employees tend to receive better performance ratings, reinforcing the link between engagement and performance.
If satisfaction is low, the company might consider enhancing the workplace (e.g., better facilities) or fostering a stronger corporate culture (e.g., recognition programs).

Analysis 2: Predictive Analytics
Objective
This analysis uses machine learning to predict human resource trends:

Which employees are most likely to leave? (Attrition prediction)
What factors influence high performance? (Performance prediction)
How can recruitment strategies be improved? (Inferred from insights)
Approach
Attrition Prediction: A classification model predicts Attrition (Yes/No).
Performance Prediction: A regression model predicts ManagerRating.
Recruitment Insights: Derived from key factors identified in both models.

1. Attrition Prediction
2. Performance Prediction

Interpretation
Attrition Prediction
Accuracy: A value above 0.7 indicates reasonable predictive power.
Classification Report: Shows precision, recall, and F1-score for Yes (leaving) and No (staying).
Feature Importances: Factors like YearsSinceLastPromotion or EnvironmentSatisfaction may rank high, suggesting that lack of growth or poor work environment drives turnover.
Performance Prediction
Mean Squared Error (MSE): A lower value (e.g., < 1.0 on a 1-5 scale) indicates better prediction accuracy.
Feature Importances: Factors like EnvironmentSatisfaction or YearsAtCompany may be key drivers of high performance.
Recruitment Strategy Improvements
From attrition insights: Hire candidates less likely to leave (e.g., those valuing stability over frequent promotions).
From performance insights: Target candidates with traits linked to high performance (e.g., adaptability to work-life balance).
