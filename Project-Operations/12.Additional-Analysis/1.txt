Analysis 1: KPI Analysis
Objective
Measure HR performance through key performance indicators (KPIs):

Employee Turnover Rate: Percentage of employees who left the company.
Employee Satisfaction: Average satisfaction score across relevant metrics.
Absenteeism Rate: Percentage of unplanned absences (placeholder, as data is not explicitly provided).
Hiring Efficiency: Time to fill vacant positions (placeholder, as data is not explicitly provided).
Assumptions
Turnover Rate: Calculated using the Attrition column ('Yes' indicates an employee has left).
Employee Satisfaction: Average of satisfaction metrics (EnvironmentSatisfaction, JobSatisfaction, RelationshipSatisfaction, WorkLifeBalance) from the latest performance review.
Absenteeism Rate: Not directly available; skipped unless a proxy is identified.
Hiring Efficiency: Not directly available; skipped unless a proxy is identified.

Interpretation
Turnover Rate: A higher percentage suggests lower workforce stability.
Employee Satisfaction: Scores closer to 5 indicate higher morale and engagement.
Absenteeism Rate & Hiring Efficiency: These require additional data (e.g., absence records or hiring timelines) to compute accurately.

Analysis 2: Turnover Analysis
Objective
Identify why employees leave the company and compare attrition patterns with recruitment and retention data. Specifically, determine if most employees leave within their first year, which could indicate onboarding or training issues.

Assumptions
Turnover Data: Uses Attrition and YearsAtCompany to analyze tenure.
Recruitment and Retention: Compares tenure distributions of attrited vs. current employees.

Interpretation
First-Year Attrition: A high percentage (e.g., >50%) suggests onboarding or job fit issues.
Tenure Distribution: Sharp peaks in early tenure for attrited employees vs. a broader spread for current employees indicate retention challenges in the initial period.
Average Tenure: Lower averages for attrited employees reinforce early departure trends.

Conclusion
This script provides:

KPI Analysis: A dashboard with turnover rate and satisfaction metrics (extendable with absenteeism and hiring data if available).
Turnover Analysis: Insights into attrition patterns, highlighting potential onboarding/training issues if first-year departures dominate.
