Step 0: Understanding the Data and Setup
Excel File Structure
The Excel file contains five sheets with the following columns:

'Employee' Sheet:
EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Gender, Age, BusinessTravel, Department, DistanceFromHome, State, Ethnicity, Education, EducationField, JobRole, MaritalStatus, Salary, StockOptionLevel, OverTime, HireDate, Attrition, YearsAtCompany, YearsInMostRecentRole, YearsSinceLastPromotion, YearsWithCurrManager
'PerformanceRating' Sheet:
PerformanceID, EmployeeID, ReviewDate, EnvironmentSatisfaction, JobSatisfaction, RelationshipSatisfaction, TrainingOpportunitiesWithinYear, TrainingOpportunitiesTaken, WorkLifeBalance, SelfRating, ManagerRating, DataQualityStatus
'EducationLevel' Sheet:
EducationLevelID, EducationLevel
'RatingLevel' Sheet:
RatingID, RatingLevel
'SatisfiedLevel' Sheet:
SatisfactionID, SatisfactionLevel
Task Overview
We need to perform three analyses:

GAP Analysis: Identify the gap between current and desired employee performance, focusing on skills or performance proxies.
9-Box Grid Analysis: Evaluate employees based on current performance and future potential, placing them in a 3x3 grid.
Balanced Scorecard Analysis: Assess HR strategies across financial performance, employee satisfaction, internal processes, and learning and growth.

Overview
We need to perform three analyses:

GAP Analysis: Identify the gap between current and desired employee performance, focusing on skills or performance proxies.
9-Box Grid Analysis: Evaluate employees based on current performance and future potential, placing them in a 3x3 grid.
Balanced Scorecard Analysis: Assess HR strategies across financial performance, employee satisfaction, internal processes, and learning and growth.
Python Libraries
Let's import the necessary libraries:
---

Step 1: Load the Data
load the Excel sheets into Pandas DataFrames. Replace 'path_to_file.xlsx' with the actual file path.
---

Step 2: GAP Analysis
Objective
Identify the gap between current and desired performance. Since explicit skills data (e.g., AI skills) isn't available, we'll use ManagerRating as a performance proxy and compare each employee's rating to the average for their JobRole, assuming the average represents the desired performance level.

Steps
Get the Latest Performance Review: Use the most recent ManagerRating per employee.
Calculate Average Rating per Job Role: Compute the benchmark for each JobRole.
Compute the Gap: Subtract the average from each employee's rating.
Analyze the Results: Visualize the gap distribution and explore correlations.

Interpretation
A negative gap indicates an employee is performing below their job role's average.
The correlation with TrainingOpportunitiesTaken suggests whether training impacts performance gaps.

Step 3: 9-Box Grid Analysis
Objective
Place employees in a 3x3 grid based on:

Current Performance: ManagerRating (low, average, high).
Future Potential: Trend of ManagerRating over time (low, average, high).
Assumptions
ManagerRating is on a 1-5 scale.
Multiple performance reviews per employee exist to calculate potential via rating trends.
Steps
Calculate Potential: Compute the slope of ManagerRating over time.
Categorize Performance: Assign ManagerRating to low (1-2), average (3), high (4-5).
Categorize Potential: Divide slopes into terciles (low, average, high).
Create the Grid: Map employees to the 9-box grid and visualize.

Interpretation
The grid shows employee counts in each category (e.g., "High Performance, High Potential").
Useful for identifying top talent (top-right) or those needing development (bottom-left).

Step 4: Balanced Scorecard Analysis
Objective
Evaluate HR performance across four perspectives:

Financial Performance: Attrition rate as a cost indicator.
Employee Satisfaction: Average satisfaction scores.
Internal Processes: Training utilization and promotion frequency.
Learning and Growth: Training participation and recent promotions.
Steps
Financial: Calculate attrition rate.
Satisfaction: Average satisfaction metrics from the latest review.
Processes: Compute training utilization and average years since promotion.
Learning: Measure training taken and recent promotion percentage.

Interpretation
Financial: High attrition may indicate financial losses due to turnover.
Satisfaction: Scores reflect employee morale (assumed 1-5 scale).
Processes: Utilization < 1 suggests underused training; high years since promotion may indicate stagnation.
Learning: High training taken and recent promotions signal growth investment.
---

Step 5: Conclusion
code performs all three analyses:

GAP Analysis: Identifies performance gaps relative to job role averages.
9-Box Grid: Maps employees by performance and potential for talent management.
Balanced Scorecard: Provides a holistic view of HR performance.
Notes
Replace 'path_to_file.xlsx' with your file path.
Adjust rating scales (e.g., ManagerRating) or thresholds if the data differs from assumptions (e.g., 1-5 scale).
If PerformanceRating has only one review per employee, modify the 9-Box potential calculation to use proxies like YearsSinceLastPromotion.
This solution is modular and can be run in a Jupyter notebook for interactive exploration. Each analysis includes visualizations to aid interpretation.
